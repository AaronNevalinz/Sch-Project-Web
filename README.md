## Challenge
- In the testimonials section was trying to resize the image to fit into the parent div container. Achieved this with the 'object-fit' property...
- CSS property of `flex`, creates an overflow that scrolls on the various media queries. ie if it's not given a property of `flex-wrap`

## Learnt
Flex containers will always create an overflow problem, to avoid this and easily capture the issue; always use 
`flex-wrap: wrap` to show you where the items of the flex container exceed the container itself. When that's done, it becomes easier to control the flow of the content.
